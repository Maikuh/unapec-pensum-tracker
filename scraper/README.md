# UNAPEC Pensum Tracker - Scraper

Web scraper part of the UNAPEC Pensum Tracker project.

The file [pensum-pages.js](pensum-pages.js) holds the links which the scraper will, well, scrape. Said file is imported in the [index.js](index.js) and then iterated. The result is a JSON file with the name _"pensums.json"_ in the same directory.

## How to run?

1. Run `npm install` in `scraper` directory
2. Run `npm start` or `npm run dev` in the `scraper` directory
3. Profit ???
